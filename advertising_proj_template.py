##Advertising project
##this project is to practice working with objects in a way that relates to real world programming examples of advertising leaflets/emails

class person:

    ##create an init function (aka constructor) for a person object with attributes: name, age, and gender

    ##create get and set functions for this object

    ##create a string function that will print out the advertising template specified in the project directions file




class pet_owner(person):

    ##create an init function for this subclass of person -- a pet owner: they will have attributes name, age, and gender inherited from
    ##person, and they will also have the pet_type attribute


    ##create get and set functions for this object


    ##create another string function -- different than the one in parent that will print out the advertising message for a pet owner



def main():

    ##create a main method that will ask for user input recursively until "QUIT" is typed -- this will be typed in the format: "name age gender" or "name age gender pet_type"

    ##then based on the type of input the user gives an object will be created for each item and then printed. 

main()
